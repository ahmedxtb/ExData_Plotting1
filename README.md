## Instructions

This repository contains four R scripts (plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R, plot4.R) and the four png images generated by these scripts (plot1.png, plot2.png, plot3.png, plot4.png). The background for these images is transparent as the reference images.

When run each script generates the png image corresponding as long as the file "household_power_consumption.txt" is in the working directory.
